- Introduce myself
  - briefly describe concurrency and why it's hard
- Learning a language is hard for most of us
  - Reasons Clojure may be worth it:
    - metaprogramming
      - macros
      - multimethods
      - runtime access to compiler
    - functional programming
      - high-order functions
      - lazy sequences
      - seq library
    - support for immutables
      - eliminates certain common complexities
      - easier to reason about, like algebra
    - leverages the JVM
      - libraries for everything
        - XML, HTTP, SQL, NoSQL, RDF, Midi, image processing, GUI, etc.
      - deployment scenarios
        - distributed computing
        - Google App Engine
      - development environments
        - IDEs, debuggers, profilers, memory usage analysis, etc.
    - concurrency
- What is concurrency?
  - loosely coordinated threads in the same process
  - not parallelism (pmap, fork/join lib)
  - not distributed (cloud/beuwulf cluster)
  - multicore
- What's tricky about concurrency?
  - looks simple, but isn't
        a=31
        b=11
        c=a+b // c=?
  - race conditions
  - deadlocks
  - unenforced policy
- Clojure's solution
  - Split value from identity
  - As much immutable values as possible
    - Immutable locals
    - Immutable collections
    - Together encourage pure functions
    - Example progression: numbers, strings, dates, any "compound object"
  - Where you must have mutability, make sure it's controlled: reference types
- Reference types in general
  - Identity
  - Course-grained mutability
  - Each type of reference has its own rules for how it takes on successive
    values over time.

- Atoms
  - Simplest, limited usefulness
  - Atomic transition from one state to the next via pure function
(inc 5) ;=> 6
(def z (atom 5))
@z ;=> 5
(swap! z inc) ;=> 6
@z ;=> 6
  - chart
39:40

- Agents
  - Also atomic transition via pure function
  - functions (called actions) queue instead of retrying
(def y (agent 5))
@y ;=> 5
y ;=> #<Agent@31554233: 5>
(send y inc) ;=> #<Agent@31554233: 6>
@y ;=> 6
  - chart
  - send vs. send-off
47:00

- Vars
  - Allow changes that are visible only within one thread
  - least like the others, no example
  - root value visible to all
  - with thread-local bindings acts like a variable
  - also used as namespaced globals
  - chart

- Refs
(def x (ref 5))
@x ;=> 5
(dosync (alter x inc)) ;=> 6
@x ;=> 6
  - This is the STM.  Note how much we've talked about Clojure concurrency
    without mentioning the STM.

  - MVCC  MultiVersion concurrency control
  - Course grained (use immutable values first, then STM)
  - Changes must occur within a transaction
    - Within a transaction, it's as if the world of refs has stopped changing
    - Can read, write, alter as needed
    - Whole transaction may retry
    - Nested transactions merge into the outer one
    - Transactions touching non-overlapping groups of refs don't impede each
      other.
  - Flying reads allowed

- Conclusion:
  - Clojure has several benefits, one of them is a cohesive treatment of
    concurrency
    - Access to Java libs
    - Lisp
    - Persistent collections
    - Seq library
    - Functional programming
    - Concurrency support
  - The foundation: value vs. identity.
  - values are immutable
  - identities are modeled by references
    - atoms for lone synchronous objects
    - agents for asynchronous
    - vars for thread-local
    - refs for synchronously coordinating multiple objects
- websites:
  clojure.org
  joyofclojure.com

All of these allow fast reads without coordination

                Atom  Agent  Var  Ref
Asynchronous     -      X     -    -
Thread-local     -      -     X    -
Coordinated      -      -     -    X
May retry        X      -     -    X
